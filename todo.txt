Release 4:

- Ideas / Strategos / Military Power
- Accordions to more places?? (unit detail?)

Tests (high priority):
- base_definition functions tested


Release 5+:

- Immutable reviver to simplify fromJS calls when transforming data?
- Index files don't really work with circular references (some types are used everywhere)
   * Own files for types?
   * Get rid of index files?
   * Fix problems one by one when they appear?

History refactor:
- Lots of data now stored, large scale battles not possible
- Could store instead the initial state + seed for random
- Next states only stored locally
- Must prevent adding units during combat (shouldn't be a big deal because even now it doesn't work that well)
- Changing modifiers, tactic, etc. should replay the combat (perhaps only when in the battle page?)
- On state load, playback to current round

Navigation:
- Toggle for simple mode, enabled by default: disables army management, disabled army selection, unit / terrain / tactic management

Settings:
- Better descriptions
- Show list of "Increase value to ...", "Decrease value too", green and red colors for increase and decrease.
- Gives a better idea how the attribute affects the result.


Siege:
- Time to capture
- Units lost to attrition
- Fort level
- Commander martial + traits
- Research bonuses

Land battle:
- Loyalty gives +10% discipline, include or not?
- Deployment order based also on manpower!! (before index), need to to test whether full strength is prioritized for both deploy and reinforce
- With multiple armies: preferred flank size is halved (not always, sometimes also unit jumps directly to middle...), filled first (reverse index order), then from middle

Navigation:
- Simulation
- Graphs
- Extra info
- Localization

- Robustness:
 - Sanity check on load? Remove modifiers which dont exist? Perhaps when things actually change
