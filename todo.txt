Release 7:

Changelog:

EUIV:
 - Morale retreat limit?
 - Tooltip needs to show source of losses (to include daily loss)

Release++:

Settings:
 - discipline: Reduces damage, only increases damage, no effect.
 - general maneuver: Affects crossing, affects terrain, affects both, no effect.
 - general: martial, fire&shock, both
 - Show on main page current settings set (Imperator, EUIV, mixed), tooltip to show individual (or only changed?)
 - New settings for deployment / reinforcement order/attribute.
 - More sections for settings (at least new section for deployment and reinforcement, game mechanics, simulation settings).

Todo:
 - Transfer could only show non-base stats for units, terrains and tactics (since base stats are supposed to regenerate?), currently it shows way too much information.
 - Refactor simluation to update only single parameter, also parameters split should make more sense
 - Some sort of place for business logic rules
 - Rowtype selectors could show unit priority? Different colors for main and flank. Frontline could slightly color tiles based on main/flank.
 - Combat things to combat reducer. Perhaps state as parameter when needed? Since it only changes same things as battle reducer,
 - Stats to show amount of traditions, trade, etc..
 - Definition functions probably all could mutate (mostly used in reducers?)
 - Winrate could automatically set precision based on unit count
 - Custom dice roll to affect all phases, add button for modal to override individual phases.
 - A button for random setup

Tests:
- utils tested
- check that reinforcement is stable (higher key ends in right position)

Tags:
 - Icons to frontline to show various things, with tooltips:
  * Defender's advantage (some kind of ninja icon?) - This is expected to be fixed so shouldn't waste time.
  * Very bad matchup, bad match up, good matchup, very good matchup (red or green arrows)
  * Flanking (attacking without being attacked)
  * No target (red sign)
 - Battle stats to show amount of tags acquired (hopefully gives a better view of the battle)
 - Battle stats to show individual units

Army management:
- Probably needed for multi-army battles because countries need to have multiple armies
- General selector to units page, renamed to army?
- Custom changes for whole country, renamed to country?
- Accordion for general?
- Accordion for reserve?
- Accordion for unit definitions?

- Accordions to more places?? (unit detail?)

Countries:
- Tag selector for tech (some inventions are tag specific)
- Tag preset selector for common tags (selects tradition, tag for tech and religion)

Land battle:
- Deployment order based also on manpower!! (before index), need to to test whether full strength is prioritized for both deploy and reinforce

Combat calculations:
- In the game, integer calculations are used so the result is rounded down after each step.
- This doesn't matter in Imperator because of higher precision but causes manpower to be bit off in EUIV.
- Implementing this slows down the combat a lot because precalculation won't be possible.
- Also the exact order of calculations must be researched or acquired from devs to get accurate results.
