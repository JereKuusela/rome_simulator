Release 8:

Changelog:

UI:
 * Added a new component for side information (shows active general, active tactic and dice roll).
 * Moved randomize dice checkbox and input for rng seed under dice extra settings (plus icon).
 * Moved morale and discipline inputs from army information component to unit information component.
 * Fixed terrain selector not showing the selection.

Refactor
 * Side and participant separated. Side now contains multiple participants.

Todo: 

Multiarmy:
 - Battle has two sides and terrain.
 - Each side includes dice (+ related things), N participants and rounds list.
 - Each participant includes country, army and days until battle.
 - CombatSide also includes active tactic and active general martial.

 - UI needs component for side: For dice and showing active martial / tactic (with damage effect).
 - UI needs a table for participants (with a way to add and delete).
 - Quick selectors need a redesign. They currently work only for one army. Still show components for both attacker and defender? But with an army selector?

 - Deployment needs rework. Need to first figure out how units from multiple armies are pooled.
 - Must also work with battle possibly restarting times (stack wipes!).

 - Army joining battle triggers deploy (without secondary penalty), remaining units get pooled together.
 - Currently pooling is done first, so can't detect reinforcement from late deploy. Units should know the turn they arrive?
  * If unit deploys during first phase and when it arrives, no penalty.
  * If unit deploys as reinforcement and after retreat, no penalty if secondary.
  * If unit deploys instantly but late, late penalty.
  * Pooled reinforcements use the leading generals settings, instant deploys current generals settings. So unit would need to know its general...
 - Needs different logic -> when army joins -> sort reserve -> deploy with its settings -> then merge to common reserve -> at end sort reserve.

UI:
 - Togglable stats rows to show individual units or hide unit types.
 - Unit tooltip should somehow show sources for losses (to include daily loss from EUIV and damage from different units).
 - Unit type selector should automatically upgrade/downgrade selected unit to a similar unit. Up to 4 choices but with no clear typing. Also remove Latest. + Setting for this.
  * Sometimes units have same offensive/defensive allocation but focuses on different attribute. Sometimes same attribute allocation but different offensive/defensive focus.
  * Seems mostly a problem for Western with so many unit types.
  * One heuristic could be: Count offensive and defensive pips of all stats, and then count offensive/defensive for two biggest stats as tiebreaker.
  * When selecting unit store its primary and secondary type as the selection. When upgrading/downgrading use these types to select the unit.

Countries:
 - Inventions to show tag specific (without actually implementing tags).
  * These inventions are extra. Perhaps a 4th slot for toggle? Or just implement scrolling?


Release++:

Settings:
 - discipline: Reduces damage, only increases damage, no effect.
 - general maneuver: Affects crossing, affects terrain, affects both, no effect.
 - general: martial, fire&shock, both
 - Show on main page current settings set (Imperator, EUIV, mixed), tooltip to show individual (or only changed?)
 - New settings for deployment / reinforcement order/attribute.
 - Settings from hardcoded.txt with auto generation.

Todo:
 - Transfer could only show non-base stats for units, terrains and tactics (since base stats are supposed to regenerate?), currently it shows way too much information.
 - Refactor simluation to update only single parameter, also parameters split should make more sense
 - Rowtype selectors could show unit priority? Different colors for main and flank. Frontline could slightly color tiles based on main/flank.
 - Combat things to combat reducer. Perhaps state as parameter when needed? Since it only changes same things as battle reducer,
 - Stats to show amount of traditions, trade, etc..
 - Definition functions probably all could mutate (mostly used in reducers?)
 - Winrate could automatically set precision based on unit count (or some other heuristic like timing first batch).
  * Could also reduce amount of units if full combat (to reduce unnecessarily large battles).
 - Save import to load battles and automatically import participants (sets those armies active and sets correct round value).
 - A button for random setup

Tests:
- utils tested
- check that reinforcement is stable (higher key ends in right position)

Tags:
 - Icons to frontline to show various things, with tooltips:
  * Defender's advantage (some kind of ninja icon?) - Needed for EUIV.
  * Very bad matchup, bad match up, good matchup, very good matchup (red or green arrows)
  * Flanking (attacking without being attacked)
  * No target (red sign)
 - Battle stats to show amount of tags acquired (hopefully gives a better view of the battle)

Land battle:
- Deployment order based also on manpower!! (before index), need to to test whether full strength is prioritized for both deploy and reinforce

Combat calculations:
- In the game, integer calculations are used so the result is rounded down after each step.
- This doesn't matter in Imperator because of higher precision but causes manpower to be bit off in EUIV.
- Implementing this slows down the combat a lot because precalculation won't be possible.
- Also the exact order of calculations must be researched or acquired from devs to get accurate results.
