Release 4:

Tests (high priority):
- base_definition functions tested

Armies page:
- Motivation is that armies, definitions and goverment modifiers would be separated, to enable mix-match
- Battle page would edit the army units and other things, separate pages for defitinitions (already exists) and modifiers
- Select which unit definitions to use
- Select which goverment modifiers to use
- Standard operations: add, duplicate, rename, remove
- Maybe also settings that are in the main page (general, roll, tactic)


Release 5+:

- Immutable reviver to simplify fromJS calls when transforming data?

History refactor:
- Lots of data now stored, large scale battles not possible
- Could store instead the initial state + seed for random
- Next states only stored locally
- Must prevent adding units during combat (shouldn't be a big deal because even now it doesn't work that well)
- Changing modifiers, tactic, etc. should replay the combat (perhaps only when in the battle page?)
- On state load, playback to current round

Navigation:
- Toggle for simple mode, enabled by default: disables army page, disabled army selection, unit / terrain / tactic management

Goverment page:
  - Single page would be the best

  - Government/Commander:
    * Strategos skill level
    * Religion skill level
    * Army/Naval wages
    * Commander skill level
    * Commander traits (Click to enable/disable)
    * Custom modifiers
    * Heritages?

  - Military traditions:
    * For both attack and defender
    * Country selector (Dropdown)
    *  List traditions (Name + Tier + Effect) based on Country
    * Toggle enabled (Click to enable/disable)
    * Affects unit definitions
    * Traditions may change -> removing a tradition should clear effect on all attributes!
    * Also on a load full reload is needed to prevent things getting out of sync

  - Trade:
    * About half trade goods have a military bonus for capital + export
    * Only Furs have a stacking bonus (for experience), probably not worth modeling
    * A list turned in a table (4 columns?, so 2 goods per row, except furs take whole row.)

  - Religion
    * 22 religions with different omens + some tag specific, each probably have 1-2 combat bonuses
    * Directly scales with Omen Power: 0 Power -> 0 Effect.
    * Power comes from Government (2 * Zeal * Loyal = 0-30%) + Religional unity (0-100%) (some countries have really weak) + 2.5% from tech + 15% theocratic_republic / theocratic_monarchy / imperial_cult
    * At top sources of Omen Power explained, single input for the value.
     - Religional unity: (0 - 100%)
     - Office: 2 * Zeal * Loyalty (0 - 30%)
     - Tech: level 2.5 * Tech (0 - 50%)
     - Inventions: 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 10 (0 - 30%)
     - Government: 15 for Theocratic Repulics, Theocratic Monarchies and Imperial Cults (0 - 15%)
     - Ideas: 20 for Mandated Observance (0 - 20%)
     - Trade: 10 for exporting Incense (0 - 10%)
     - Laws: 10 for Republican, 10/-15 for Tribe (-15% - 10%)
     - Ruler trait -5/5 (-5% - 5%)
     - Total: (-20% - 270%)

  - Heritages
    * Lots of, but not many affect military. Still a table / list with single selection.
    * Note: global_defensive is fort defense.
    * Note: discipline only affects land units

  - Governemnt
    * Ideas: 5 Military ones
    * Laws: Republican: 2 Military, Monarch: 1 Military, Tribe: 0 Military, Rome has technically same as Republican

  - Tech
    * Military adds moral
    * Military has lots of useful, full table?

  - General
    * Skill level
    * 7 military traits have effect, 6 have effect related to sieges
