Release 9:

Changelog:

"Battle" page:
 * Improved UI performance by caching army data.
 * Added support for gaining attributes (opposite of losses), for example morale gain for winning a battle in EU4.
 * EU4: Fixed flank ratio to work with multiarmy battle. Ratio is calculated and penalty applied invidiually for each army.
 * Fixed dice extra settings button disappearing when random dice is enabled.
 * Added a counter to frontline to show amount of units in the battle.

"Definitions" page:
 * Updated unit values to match 2.0 changes.
 * Renamed terrains to match in-game names.
 * Added Engineer cohort.
 * Added support for editing terrain combat width.
 * Added "Duel" terrain with a combat width of 1 (for testing purposes).
 * Removed land/naval splitting from terrains. There aren't that many terrains to justify increased code complexity.
 * Loyalty now also decreases maintenance costs.

"Settings" page:
 * Default values are now generated from game data files.
 * EU4: Added a setting for morale gain when winning a battle.
 * EU4: Defender's advantage is now disabled by default (fixed in the game).
 * Fixed setting import/export not working.
 * Changed settings page from tabs to accordions. This makes changing settings much easier because they all are on screen and can be searched with the browser.

"Countries" page:
 * Updated values to match 2.0 changes.
 * Added a checkbox to toggle whether to hide non-combat related effects (not fully supported yet).
 * Removed culture selector as it no longer dictates military traditions.
 * Replaced military tradition tree with a table (no fancy rendering like in game). Removed all requirement-related logic so traditions can be freely picked.
 * Added a military tree selector to change the displayed tree. Selections from other trees are persisted.
 * Military experience input now displays the effect on morale.
 * Replaced tech / invention tree with an invention table (no fancy rendering like in game). Removed all requirement-related logic so inventions can be freely picked.
 * Added an input for tech levels.
 * Added all inventions (even non-military ones). These allow inspecting what inventions countries have when importing save files.

"Import from save" page: 
 * Fixed invention importing to work with 2.0 format.
 * Added importing for all tech categories.
 * Removed the button to only improve armies. I don't think this is a useful feature so it only adds clutter to the UI.
 * Removed army selector as it no longer has any purpose.

"Export from save" page: 
 * Added a tool for exporting a table with territories and their pops.


Todo: 

Saves:
 
 * Add import from battle (involved armies) or war (all participants and all armies)
  -Also import territory + check for mountain pass modifier.
 * Fix tradition import.


Countries:
 * Great works??

Combat:
 * River/strait crossing negation when 1 engineer for every 10 cohort (+ setting). Try to verify is it 1 + 9 others or 1 + 10 others.
UI:
 * Add tooltip to frontline unit counter (shows combat width, amount of units with breakdown per type, maybe total morale/strength too?)

Release++:

Countries:
 - Data converter for EU4.
  * Each country has tag / group specific ideas -> Dropdown with tag and group names -> 1 table with 1 x 7 ideas?
  * Each country has access to same basic ideas -> ~15 available, 9 can be unlocked -> 3 tables with 5 groups x 7 ideas?
   - Can filter ideas groups with no military buffs
  * Completing basic ideas unlock policies -> A big list of options (like with IR Trade)


Tests:
 * Tests:
  - Precision. In-game test with many rounds to verify that calculation accuracy matches the game.
  - Different mechanics, no in-game comparison required since all are just damage modifiers.
* Deployment
  - Many scenarios
  - Based also on manpower!! (before index), need to to test whether full strength is prioritized for both deploy and reinforce
  - Late deployment (with and without penalty)
* Reinforcement
  - Non-secondary penalty
  - Better general changing order
* Mechanics
  - Flank ratio
* utils tested

Refactor:
 -? Moving terrain attributes to terrain definitions:
  - Could applied as a modifier to units when a terrain is selected, instead of showing separately on unit definition and requiring special handling.
  - Downside is that in game the modifiers are shown next to units, so the UI would differ from the game.

UI:
 - Togglable stats rows to show individual units or hide unit types.
 - Unit tooltip should somehow show sources for losses (to include daily loss from EU4 and damage from different units).
 - Unit type selector should automatically upgrade/downgrade selected unit to a similar unit. Up to 4 choices but with no clear typing. Also remove Latest. + Setting for this.
  * Sometimes units have same offensive/defensive allocation but focuses on different attribute. Sometimes same attribute allocation but different offensive/defensive focus.
  * Seems mostly a problem for Western with so many unit types.
  * One heuristic could be: Count offensive and defensive pips of all stats, and then count offensive/defensive for two biggest stats as tiebreaker.
  * When selecting unit store its primary and secondary type as the selection. When upgrading/downgrading use these types to select the unit.

Settings:
 - Show on main page current settings set (Imperator, EU4, mixed), tooltip to show individual (or only changed?)

Todo:
 - Transfer could only show non-base stats for units, terrains and tactics (since base stats are supposed to regenerate?), currently it shows way too much information.
 - Rowtype selectors could show unit priority? Different colors for main and flank. Frontline could slightly color tiles based on main/flank.
 - Stats to show amount of traditions, trade, etc..
 - Definition functions probably all could mutate (mostly used in reducers?)
 - Save import to load battles and automatically import participants (sets those armies active and sets correct round value).
 - A button for random setup
 - Excel export to get stats for each round?

Tags:
 - Icons to frontline to show various things, with tooltips:
  * Very bad matchup, bad match up, good matchup, very good matchup (red or green arrows)
  * Flanking (attacking without being attacked)
  * No target (red sign)
 - Battle stats to show amount of tags acquired (hopefully gives a better view of the battle)

Analyze:
 - Analyze could be more optimized when both sides have a single army (the most common scenario?), no need to store deployed etc...
 - Saves nodes should probably clear the state to avoid weird combat situations.
 - Refactor analyze to update only single parameter, also parameters split should make more sense.
 - Analyze could automatically set precision based on unit count (or some other heuristic like timing first batch).
 - Analyze width compress:
  * Deploy, check that all units have same type, fight one round, check that all units have same strength/morale -> can be simulated 1v1.
  * Do above until units run out -> Amount of possible 1v1.
  * Improves performance up to 30x.
  * Similar thing could also be done for left and right side (but only 2x performance and flanking/movement needs special implementation.
 - Allow analyzing multiple armies against each other. Like if you want to know what is the best HI now you need to manually do comparisons.
  * AgGrid or something required for better table support?

Combat calculations:
- In the game, integer calculations are used so the result is rounded down after each step.
- This doesn't matter in Imperator because of higher precision but causes manpower to be bit off in EU4.
- Implementing this slows down the combat a lot because precalculation won't be possible.
- Also the exact order of calculations must be researched or acquired from devs to get accurate results.
