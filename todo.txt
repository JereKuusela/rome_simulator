Release 4:

Tests (high priority):
- base_definition functions tested

Armies page:
- Motivation is that armies, definitions and goverment modifiers would be separated, to enable mix-match
- Battle page would edit the army units and other things, separate pages for defitinitions (already exists) and modifiers
- Select which unit definitions to use
- Select which goverment modifiers to use
- Standard operations: add, duplicate, rename, remove
- Maybe also settings that are in the main page (general, roll, tactic)

Release 5+:

- Immutable reviver to simplify fromJS calls when transforming data?

History refactor:
- Lots of data now stored, large scale battles not possible
- Could store instead the initial state + seed for random
- Next states only stored locally
- Must prevent adding units during combat (shouldn't be a big deal because even now it doesn't work that well)
- Changing modifiers, tactic, etc. should replay the combat (perhaps only when in the battle page?)
- On state load, playback to current round
