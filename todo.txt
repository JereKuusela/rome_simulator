Release 8:

Changelog:



Todo: 


Release++:

Tests:
 * Tests:
  - Precision. In-game test with many rounds to verify that calculation accuracy matches the game.
  - Different mechanics, no in-game comparison required since all are just damage modifiers.
* Deployment
  - Many scenarios
  - Based also on manpower!! (before index), need to to test whether full strength is prioritized for both deploy and reinforce
  - Late deployment (with and without penalty)
* Reinforcement
  - Non-secondary penalty
  - Better general changing order
* Mechanics
  - Flank ratio
* utils tested

UI:
 - Togglable stats rows to show individual units or hide unit types.
 - Unit tooltip should somehow show sources for losses (to include daily loss from EUIV and damage from different units).
 - Unit type selector should automatically upgrade/downgrade selected unit to a similar unit. Up to 4 choices but with no clear typing. Also remove Latest. + Setting for this.
  * Sometimes units have same offensive/defensive allocation but focuses on different attribute. Sometimes same attribute allocation but different offensive/defensive focus.
  * Seems mostly a problem for Western with so many unit types.
  * One heuristic could be: Count offensive and defensive pips of all stats, and then count offensive/defensive for two biggest stats as tiebreaker.
  * When selecting unit store its primary and secondary type as the selection. When upgrading/downgrading use these types to select the unit.

Countries:
 - Inventions to show tag specific (without actually implementing tags).
  * These inventions are extra. Perhaps a 4th slot for toggle? Or just implement scrolling?


Settings:
 - Show on main page current settings set (Imperator, EUIV, mixed), tooltip to show individual (or only changed?)
 - Settings from hardcoded.txt with auto generation.

Todo:
 - Transfer could only show non-base stats for units, terrains and tactics (since base stats are supposed to regenerate?), currently it shows way too much information.
 - Rowtype selectors could show unit priority? Different colors for main and flank. Frontline could slightly color tiles based on main/flank.
 - Stats to show amount of traditions, trade, etc..
 - Definition functions probably all could mutate (mostly used in reducers?)
 - Save import to load battles and automatically import participants (sets those armies active and sets correct round value).
 - A button for random setup
 - Excel export to get stats for each round?

Tags:
 - Icons to frontline to show various things, with tooltips:
  * Defender's advantage (some kind of ninja icon?) - Needed for EUIV.
  * Very bad matchup, bad match up, good matchup, very good matchup (red or green arrows)
  * Flanking (attacking without being attacked)
  * No target (red sign)
 - Battle stats to show amount of tags acquired (hopefully gives a better view of the battle)

Analyze:
 - Analyze could be more optimized when both sides have a single army (the most common scenario?), no need to store deployed etc...
 - Saves nodes should probably clear the state to avoid weird combat situations.
 - Refactor analyze to update only single parameter, also parameters split should make more sense.
 - Analyze could automatically set precision based on unit count (or some other heuristic like timing first batch).
 - Analyze width compress:
  * Deploy, check that all units have same type, fight one round, check that all units have same strength/morale -> can be simulated 1v1.
  * Do above until units run out -> Amount of possible 1v1.
  * Improves performance up to 30x.
  * Similar thing could also be done for left and right side (but only 2x performance and flanking/movement needs special implementation.
 - Allow analyzing multiple armies against each other. Like if you want to know what is the best HI now you need to manually do comparisons.
  * AgGrid or something required for better table support?

Combat calculations:
- In the game, integer calculations are used so the result is rounded down after each step.
- This doesn't matter in Imperator because of higher precision but causes manpower to be bit off in EUIV.
- Implementing this slows down the combat a lot because precalculation won't be possible.
- Also the exact order of calculations must be researched or acquired from devs to get accurate results.
