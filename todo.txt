Release 9:

Changelog:

Refactor:
  * IR: Configuration can now be generated from data files (easier maintenance with less errors).
  * Data generator was split to better support EU4 (modifier names got mixed up with IR modifiers).
  * Added support for gaining attributes (opposite of losses), for example morale gain for winning a battle in EU4.

Combat:
  * IR: Loyalty now also decreases maintenance costs.
  * EU4: Fixed flank ratio to work with multiarmy battle. Ratio is calculated and penalty applied invidiually for each army.

Settings:
 * EU4: Added a setting for morale gain when winning a battle.
 * EU4: Defender's advantage is now disabled by default (fixed in the game).

UI:
 * Fixed dice extra settings button disappearing when random dice is enabled.

Save import:
  * Added a tool for exporting a table with territories and their pops.


Todo: 

Saves:
 - Add import from battle (involved armies) or war (all participants and all armies)

Countries:
 - Data converter for EU4.
  * Each country has tag / group specific ideas -> Dropdown with tag and group names -> 1 table with 1 x 7 ideas?
  * Each country has access to same basic ideas -> ~15 available, 9 can be unlocked -> 3 tables with 5 groups x 7 ideas?
   - Can filter ideas groups with no military buffs
  * Completing basic ideas unlock policies -> A big list of options (like with IR Trade)


Release++:

Tests:
 * Tests:
  - Precision. In-game test with many rounds to verify that calculation accuracy matches the game.
  - Different mechanics, no in-game comparison required since all are just damage modifiers.
* Deployment
  - Many scenarios
  - Based also on manpower!! (before index), need to to test whether full strength is prioritized for both deploy and reinforce
  - Late deployment (with and without penalty)
* Reinforcement
  - Non-secondary penalty
  - Better general changing order
* Mechanics
  - Flank ratio
* utils tested

UI:
 - Togglable stats rows to show individual units or hide unit types.
 - Unit tooltip should somehow show sources for losses (to include daily loss from EU4 and damage from different units).
 - Unit type selector should automatically upgrade/downgrade selected unit to a similar unit. Up to 4 choices but with no clear typing. Also remove Latest. + Setting for this.
  * Sometimes units have same offensive/defensive allocation but focuses on different attribute. Sometimes same attribute allocation but different offensive/defensive focus.
  * Seems mostly a problem for Western with so many unit types.
  * One heuristic could be: Count offensive and defensive pips of all stats, and then count offensive/defensive for two biggest stats as tiebreaker.
  * When selecting unit store its primary and secondary type as the selection. When upgrading/downgrading use these types to select the unit.

Countries:
 - Inventions to show tag specific (without actually implementing tags).
  * These inventions are extra. Perhaps a 4th slot for toggle? Or just implement scrolling?


Settings:
 - Show on main page current settings set (Imperator, EU4, mixed), tooltip to show individual (or only changed?)

Todo:
 - Transfer could only show non-base stats for units, terrains and tactics (since base stats are supposed to regenerate?), currently it shows way too much information.
 - Rowtype selectors could show unit priority? Different colors for main and flank. Frontline could slightly color tiles based on main/flank.
 - Stats to show amount of traditions, trade, etc..
 - Definition functions probably all could mutate (mostly used in reducers?)
 - Save import to load battles and automatically import participants (sets those armies active and sets correct round value).
 - A button for random setup
 - Excel export to get stats for each round?

Tags:
 - Icons to frontline to show various things, with tooltips:
  * Very bad matchup, bad match up, good matchup, very good matchup (red or green arrows)
  * Flanking (attacking without being attacked)
  * No target (red sign)
 - Battle stats to show amount of tags acquired (hopefully gives a better view of the battle)

Analyze:
 - Analyze could be more optimized when both sides have a single army (the most common scenario?), no need to store deployed etc...
 - Saves nodes should probably clear the state to avoid weird combat situations.
 - Refactor analyze to update only single parameter, also parameters split should make more sense.
 - Analyze could automatically set precision based on unit count (or some other heuristic like timing first batch).
 - Analyze width compress:
  * Deploy, check that all units have same type, fight one round, check that all units have same strength/morale -> can be simulated 1v1.
  * Do above until units run out -> Amount of possible 1v1.
  * Improves performance up to 30x.
  * Similar thing could also be done for left and right side (but only 2x performance and flanking/movement needs special implementation.
 - Allow analyzing multiple armies against each other. Like if you want to know what is the best HI now you need to manually do comparisons.
  * AgGrid or something required for better table support?

Combat calculations:
- In the game, integer calculations are used so the result is rounded down after each step.
- This doesn't matter in Imperator because of higher precision but causes manpower to be bit off in EU4.
- Implementing this slows down the combat a lot because precalculation won't be possible.
- Also the exact order of calculations must be researched or acquired from devs to get accurate results.
