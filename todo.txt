Todo:
 - Transfer could only show non-base stats for units, terrains and tactics (since base stats are supposed to regenerate?), currently it shows way too much information.
 - Refactor simluation to update only single parameter, also parameters split should make more sense
 - Some sort of place for business logic rules

Tags:
 - Icons to frontline to show various things, with tooltips:
  * Defender's advantage (some kind of ninja icon?) - This is expected to be fixed so shouldn't waste time.
  * Very bad matchup, bad match up, good matchup, very good matchup (red or green arrows)
  * Flanking (attacking without being attacked)
  * No target (red sign)
 - Battle stats to show amount of tags acquired (hopefully gives a better view of the battle)
 - Battle stats to show individual units

Settings:
 - Better descriptions
 - Show default value
 - Show current change versus default value (for example faster battles, more randomness)
 - New settings for deployment / reinforcement order/attribute.
 - More sections for settings (at least new section for deployment and reinforcement, game mechanics, simulation settings).

EUIV:
 - Tooltip needs to show source of losses (to include daily loss)
 - Military tactics as defensive value (+ setting)
 - Derivate attributes (reduce flanking range based on strength)
 - Cavalry to infantry ratio (flank to front, country definition, + setting)
 - General maneuver pips
 - Setting for martial cap (0 for disabled)
 - Units: Available units determined by tech level + culture (selector should sort by tech level + show pips)
 - Units on the backline take full morale casualties
 - Combat ability directly increases damage
 - General and unit pips affect dice rolls (enemy ones reduce)

Tests:
- utils tested
- check that reinforcement is stable (higher key ends in right position)

Rowtype selectors could show unit priority? Different colors for main and flank. Frontline could slightly color tiles based on main/flank.

Pluralization of reducers, state, etc

Combat things to combat reducer. Perhaps state as parameter when needed? Since it only changes same things as battle reducer,

Stats to show amount of traditions, trade, etc..


Release++:

Army management:
- Probably needed for multi-army battles because countries need to have multiple armies
- General selector to units page, renamed to army?
- Custom changes for whole country, renamed to country?
- Accordion for general?
- Accordion for reserve?
- Accordion for unit definitions?

- Accordions to more places?? (unit detail?)

Countries:
- Tag selector for tech (some inventions are tag specific)
- Tag preset selector for common tags (selects tradition, tag for tech and religion)

Land battle:
- Deployment order based also on manpower!! (before index), need to to test whether full strength is prioritized for both deploy and reinforce
